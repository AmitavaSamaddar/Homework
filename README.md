The following files are uploaded -

1. Assignment2Screenshots.docx          -- this is for screenshots (partial)
2. Multiple_year_stock_data_Amitava.vb  -- this is the vbs script for the assignment

I also have uploaded the actual excel file -

3. Multiple_year_stock_data_Amitava.xlsm

Please note - 'Yearly Change' (Column J) is showing data for only two digits as the 'Open' and 'Close' are also showing 2 digits.  I've tried changing the format and increase number of decimal places, but it still doesn't showing the exact result which is shown in the assignemnt details.  Discussed this with Ryan (the TA) and Ryan mentioned that showing 2 digits will be fine.
